Phaser Game Project

This project is a simple game developed using Phaser, a popular framework for making browser-based games. It features a movable dot that responds to keyboard inputs (W, A, S, D).
Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

    Node.js: This project requires Node.js to run the development server. Download and install it from nodejs.org.
    npm (Node Package Manager): Comes with Node.js, used to install dependencies.

Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running:

    Clone the Repository: First, clone this repository to your local machine using:

    sh

git clone [repository link]

Navigate to the Project Directory: Once cloned, enter the project directory:

sh

cd path/to/project

Install HTTP Server (if not already installed):

sh

    npm install -g http-server

    This will install a simple, zero-configuration command-line HTTP server.

Running the Game

To run the game, follow these steps:

    Start the Server:

    sh

    http-server

    This will start the local server. By default, it serves on port 8080.

    Open the Game:

    Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080. You should see the game running.

Developing the Game
File Structure

    index.html: The main HTML file for the game.
    game.js: Contains the game logic and Phaser configuration.
    assets/: Directory for game assets like images, sounds, etc. (if any)

Editing the Game

You can modify game.js to change the game mechanics or add new features. Use any text editor or IDE of your choice.
Testing

For testing changes:

    Make your changes in the game.js or other relevant files.
    Refresh your browser to see the updates.
